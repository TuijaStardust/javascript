"We can talk to a server in order to send and receive data."

User of an app (Web browser) sends a request to a server
-> Server sends back response 

Why do we want to use a server?
- Communication: let users access the app (App needs to be able to listen to incoming requests and send back responses )
- Trusted environment for running the code; The code can't be tampered/manipulated by the user of the application 

JavaScript language
    -> JS in the web browser environment
    -> JS in a server environment: node.js 

"Web browser does web browser'ish things, node.js does general computer'ish things" 

NODE.JS
=======  

- Ability to create files and folders to computer hard-drive
- Ability to listen to incoming network requests
- etc...

# Executing node in terminal; filename doesn't require .js ending
node [filename]

EXPRESS
=======

Pre-written JS code for Node environment that can be leveraged
